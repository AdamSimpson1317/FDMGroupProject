**Steps to run the program:**

From IntelliJ, open the FDMGroupProject folder and run the main function in the main class. This will open the Menu Screen interface which is used to access the games and leader boards.

You may be asked to login to linux.cs.ncl.ac.uk throughout the program, so you are able to load questions and to access the leader boards.

**Welcome to the FDM Group brand game.**

Here you will be able to play three different minigames to learn more about three streams that are on offer as graduate programs. The three streams are Software Testing, Business Intelligence and Technical Operations. 
More information can be found at https://www.fdmgroup.com/

The information used in these games takes information from the corresponding webpage available on the FDM Group website, however, a little research may be needed for harder questions that go into more detail. The idea of the games is to give you an introduction as to what each stream is about interactively.

There are three games to choose from:
* Fill in The Blanks – In this game, you will be presented with a block of text that has some words missing. The task is to choose the correct word to fill in the gap from a selection of words. Once you have filled in the words for all questions, you can submit your answers and view your score. You can answer the questions in any order using the navigation bar at the bottom of the window.
* Match the Keyword – This game will present you with some keywords, and description. It is your task to match the keywords on the left-hand side with the correct description on the right-hand side. Once you have correctly identified all the matches, you will be given a score.
* Test Your Knowledge Quiz – Take a quiz to test how much you have learned about each stream. You will be asked a question, and you can select your answer to the question. There is a bookmark button which will create a bookmark button, allowing you to return to the question later. After all questions are answered you will be presented with your score for the quiz.

Each game is expected to take no longer than 2 minutes to complete.

To access the games:
* Press the begin button at the title screen.
* Select a stream to research. The games will then relate to the chosen stream.
* Select a minigame to play using the chosen stream.
* Once you have finished, your score will be written to the leader board, and you can return to the main menu.


To access leader boards:
* Press the begin button at the title screen.
* Choose the show leader boards option from the option buttons at the bottom of the window.
* Choose the stream and game you wish to see the leader board for from the drop down boxes.
* Choose a filter option, either displaying the top 5, 10 or 20 results, or filtering all scores past a certain date.
* If you selected to filter by date you will be asked to enter a date.
* Select show leader board and it will open a new window with the leader board that you have requested.
